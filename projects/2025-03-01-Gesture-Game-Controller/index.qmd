# Project Description

This project explores mid-air UI manipulation using two IMU-equipped Arduino boards for gesture-based control. Various prototypes were evaluated, including two-handed, single-hand, and wand-based designs. The final prototype was re-
fined through model enhancements, stability thresholds, confidence filtering, and UI optimizations. User testing measured task completion time, error rates, and prediction stability, demonstrating improved efficiency and usability. The final system achieved robust gesture recognition, highlighting its potential for intuitive human-computer interaction.
