# Music Magicians: Spotify Music Artist Influence Analytics Dashboard

<!-- ![](images/Flight_Delay_Prediction_Pipelining_Flowchart.png) -->

I developed an interactive analytics dashboard using Streamlit, Vega-Altair, Plotly, NetworkX, and Python. The dashboard focuses on exploring the evolution of music and quantifying artists' influence. It features informative visualizations and interactive elements to analyze music trends, artist characteristics, and the influence of past music on new compositions. This project successfully addressed the challenge by creating a user-friendly interface that facilitates in-depth exploration of the dataset, enabling storytelling and uncovering patterns and correlations in music.
