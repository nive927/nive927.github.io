## ðŸ§  How I Work

I'm an engineer who thrives at the intersection of **Machine Learning Systems**, **High-performance Data & Computing Infrastructure**, and **Product-Focused Thinking**. As an INTJ-A, I approach problems with a systems mindset-breaking down complexity into clear abstractions and scalable workflows.

I operate with urgency and intention. Iâ€™m most engaged when iterating quickly, building reliable solutions that scale quietly behind the scenes, and turning ambiguous problems into actionable plans. Whether itâ€™s an LLM agent, a real-time ETL pipeline, or an edge-deployed model, I enjoy driving ideas from prototype to production.

## ðŸ›  Operating Principles

- **Own the Full Stack:** From backend services to ML deployment, I take responsibility for system performance, reliability, and user experience.
- **Build for Scale and Clarity:** I reduce operational overhead by designing interfaces and pipelines that are modular, observable, and easy to extend.
- **Bias for Iteration:** I move fast, deliver early, and treat experimentation as a core part of engineeringâ€”not a separate step.
- **Keep the End-User in Mind:** Whether Iâ€™m building an ML co-pilot or internal tooling, I optimize for clarity, trust, and usefulness.
- **Learn Fast, Dive Deep:** I ramp quickly into unfamiliar domains, ask good questions, and continuously sharpen my technical judgment.
- **Document and Share:** I make my thinking visible early, unblock teammates through clear async communication, and open-source when I can.

## ðŸ’¡ Personal Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy rapid prototyping under constraintsâ€”whether itâ€™s during hackathons (see [Awards](https://nive927.github.io/awards.html)) or solo weekend builds.

I'm a 108 WPM touch typist and a keyboard enthusiast who loves working close to the metal, especially when designing fast, usable command-line interfaces. In undergrad, I led a robotics team that developed two underwater navigation suites, **KYOGRE** and **ORCA**, for inspection-class autonomous marine vehicles.

Whether itâ€™s through competitive projects, emerging tech, or deep system dives, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, craft, and the satisfaction of building things that work well at scale.
