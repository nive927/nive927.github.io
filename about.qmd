I'm Nivedhitha Dhanasekaran. I am a Master of Computational Data Science Student at Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from 2018-2022 in Chennai, India. While progressing through my undergraduate curriculum, I had the opportunity to work on projects in Full Stack Engineering, Data Science, and Deep Learning. In these projects, I participated in all the stages of the software development lifecycle, focusing on scalability, reliability, and user experience. I also have limited research experience in Computer Vision, Computational Biomedicine, and Robotics.

Subsequently, I was a Technical Analyst at Citi, collaborating with the engineering and product teams to comprehend customer needs, implement technology solutions, and deliver exciting projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring strategies, books, habits & tools that help me live a happier, healthier, and more productive life. A fun fact about me is that I'm a textbook INTJ-A personality type.
